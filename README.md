- Easy to use

<br>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

Open powershell **as Admin** and execute the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shravan-1908/iris/master/scripts/windows_install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing).Content | powershell -
```

This installation script will automatically add iris to PATH and startup applications, so whenever the PC is booted, iris will be launched.

<br>

## üí´ Motivation
I wanted a wallpaper manager which gave a bing wallpaper + nitrogen like interface, good wallpapers and customizability with a bunch of features.

<br>

## üí° Usage

### Root command

Simply calling `iris` without any flags or arguments from the terminal would launch iris and it will change the desktop wallpaper according to the set configuration.

### Customization

iris uses [unsplash](https://source.unsplash.com) for fetching remote wallpapers. However, you can use your own collection of wallpapers too.

You can customize iris to work as you wish by editing the `config.json` located in `~/.iris` folder. The first time you run iris, it automatically creates a `config.json` file with default configuration, which looks like this:

```json
{
    "search_terms": [
        "nature"
    ],
    "resolution": "1600x900",
    "change_wallpaper": false,
    "change_wallpaper_duration": -1,
    "wallpaper_directory": "",
    "selection_type": "random",
    "save_wallpaper": false
}
```

All configuration fields are pretty self explanatory, still I'd like to describe them all in brief.

- Search Terms: The search terms for unsplash images, i.e., which kind of wallpaper do you want. You can have multiple search terms, but its recommended to not to have more than 3 since it narrows down the search results.

- Resolution: The desired wallpaper resolution. Can only be one of the following:
    * `1024x768`
	* `1600x900`
	* `1920x1080`
	* `3840x2160`

- Change wallpaper: Boolean value for whether to continuously change wallpapers or not.

- Change wallpaper duration: If to change wallpapers, then after how long. The duration value will be counted in minutes. Defaults to 15 mins if the change wallpaper property is set to true.

- Wallpaper directory: Specify your own wallpaper directory if you don't want iris to use unsplash.

- Selection type: If to use wallpapers from the local system, then what should be the selection type: random or sorted.

- Save wallpaper: Boolean value for whether to save the unsplash wallpapers or delete them after usage. If this is set to true, then the wallpapers will be stored in `~/.iris/wallpapers` directory.

### Update

To update iris, run
```
iris up
```
This will update iris to its latest version.
